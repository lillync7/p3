•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program is for Chada Tech’s Corner Grocer. It is intended to track and document the frequency of produce purchased in the store. The intent is for the Corner Grocer to bet able to see what sell the most to arrange the produce section accordingly.
•	What did you do particularly well?
My while loop to execute the menu options I feel I did well. The loop incorporates each of the menu options and links to the necessary functions. 
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I am not sure exactly how I could enhance my code. I am still learning and I believe I will learn good ways to improve my code to make it more efficient and secure. I just have not yet.
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found writing the functions to read and write the files to be most difficult. Reviewing the Zybooks did not help much so I Googled how to do it. I was able to find websites that explained how to do it and included examples of what the code could look like. One of the sites I found to be the most useful for me is GeeksforGeeks. I have found that the site explains things in a way I understand better. Videos are preferred but this helped me. 
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Explaining what the why and how the code works after I was finished is helpful. Knowing the why and how of a code is important for any coding project. Understanding the why and how of each part of the code is important for planning for future maintenance of the code when writing it.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept everything simple and used terms that cannot be easily mixed up with other words. I also included inline comments in places to remind the person working with the code of what each part if for and how it is meant to work.
